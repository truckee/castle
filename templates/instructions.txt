    When adding a page to the site:
    Use the /templates/page_template.html for a starter
    Entries required on lines 6 (title), 13 (images), 19 (brief desc), 20 (contents)
    Try to keep the page at the same path level for assets; otherwise adjust hrefs

Page management:
    Each page is divided into two pieces - a constant set of code used for every page and a 
    unique set of code for each individual page. This makes it easier to work with each
    unique page.
