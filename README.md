<p align=center><b>Castle Rock HOA</b></p>

A neighborhood of 182 houses on the southern face of Peavine Peak, Nevada.

The elevation here is about 5,400' above sea level. We're on the northern border of the Sierra Vista Park, a former golf course now serving as a bicycling park for all of Reno. Many homes here have fantastic views of the Mount Rose Wilderness and the Crystal Range mountains in California.
